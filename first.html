        <id class="backgroundtext">FIRST's mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, 
            by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, 
            that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, 
            communication, and leadership. FIRST was founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and participation 
            in science and technology. Based in Manchester, NH, not-for-profit public charity designs 
            accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in 
            science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.
